# Walkthroughs

This folder contains experiential walkthroughs documenting real learning processes, experiments, and technical exploration within Ctrl+Alt+Master.

Walkthroughs focus on what it’s actually like to learn, practice, and problem-solve — including missteps, resets, and breakthroughs.

---

## What belongs here

Walkthroughs may include:
- CTF attempts and reflections
- Lab or environment setup experiences
- Tool exploration and experimentation
- Learning pivots after confusion or failure
- Re-entry into technical practice after time away

These are not polished tutorials. They are honest, technically grounded narratives of learning in motion.

---

## What walkthroughs are not

- Step-by-step “how-to” guides without context
- Finished technical documentation
- Performative success stories
- Content written to impress rather than inform

If the goal is teaching a concept clearly, it likely belongs in Guides instead.

---

## Format

Walkthroughs may be published externally (blogs, documents, videos, etc.) and linked here once complete.

Each walkthrough should include:
- A descriptive title
- A short summary of what was explored
- Tools or environments involved (if applicable)
- A link to the full walkthrough

---

## Tone & intent

Walkthroughs should be:
- Honest about uncertainty and learning curves
- Technically accurate without over-explaining
- Free from shame, comparison, or gatekeeping
- Focused on ethical learning and practice

The purpose of walkthroughs is to normalize learning as a process — not to present mastery as a prerequisite.
