# Guides

This folder is home to educational guides created or curated by the Ctrl+Alt+Master community.

Guides are designed to help people understand concepts, tools, and workflows in cybersecurity and adjacent technical spaces without gatekeeping or assumptions about background.

---

## What belongs here

Guides should focus on clarity and practical understanding, such as:

- How to get started with CTFs, labs, or challenges
- How to choose tools, platforms, or learning paths
- How to build sustainable study or practice habits
- How to approach common technical concepts at different skill levels

Guides may be written for beginners, intermediate learners, or experienced practitioners revisiting fundamentals.

---

## What guides are not

- Personal journals or experience logs (those belong in walkthroughs)
- Raw link dumps without context
- Promotional or sales content
- “One true way” explanations that discourage exploration

---

## Format

Guides may live outside GitHub (Google Docs, PDFs, blog posts, etc.) and be linked here once finalized.

Each guide should include:
- A clear title
- A short description of who it’s for
- A link to the full content

---

## Tone & values

Guides should reflect Ctrl+Alt+Master’s core principles:
- No gatekeeping
- No shame for learning at any stage
- Ethical and responsible use of technical knowledge
- Clear, grounded explanations over hype

This folder exists to make learning more accessible, not more overwhelming.
