# Templates

This folder contains reusable templates created or curated by the Ctrl+Alt+Master community to support learning, practice, and organization.

Templates are designed to help people structure their work, reflect on progress, and build sustainable technical habits.

---

## What belongs here

Templates may include:
- Study or practice planners
- CTF or lab tracking sheets
- Reflection or debrief frameworks
- Checklists for setup, review, or reset
- Organizational systems for learning workflows

Templates should be practical, reusable, and clearly structured.

---

## What templates are not

- Long-form guides or explanations
- Personal journals or walkthroughs
- One-off notes without reuse value
- Commercial products or paid offerings

Templates are meant to support learning, not replace it.

---

## Format

Templates may be hosted outside GitHub (Canva, Google Docs, PDFs, etc.) and linked here once finalized.

Each template should include:
- A clear name
- A short description of its purpose
- Instructions for use (brief)
- A link to the template

## Use & licensing

Templates in this folder are shared for personal and educational use in alignment with the repository’s license.

They may not be modified, redistributed, or used commercially without explicit permission from the project organizers.

This ensures templates remain accessible while protecting the creative and structural work behind them.
