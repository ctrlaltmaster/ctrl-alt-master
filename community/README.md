## Community Principles

Ctrl+Alt+Master is guided by a few core principles:

- **Ethical practice**  
  Learning and experimentation here are intended for lawful, responsible use only.

- **No gatekeeping**  
  Expertise is not a prerequisite for participation, and no one is expected to prove their worth.

- **Curiosity over performance**  
  Growth comes from asking questions, trying things, and learning from mistakes.

- **Respect for time and energy**  
  This community values sustainable engagement over burnout or constant availability.

## Participation

Most community interaction happens through Discord. Members are encouraged to:

- Share relevant events, resources, and opportunities
- Ask questions and offer help when able
- Participate in discussions with curiosity and respect
- Learn at their own pace without pressure to keep up

This is not a competition space. Comparison and ranking are not the focus.

## Expectations

Ctrl+Alt+Master is a collaborative environment. Harassment, discrimination, or behavior that undermines the safety or inclusion of others is not tolerated.

More detailed behavioral guidelines and moderation policies are outlined in the Code of Conduct.

## Growing Together

Ctrl+Alt+Master is intentionally built to evolve. Feedback is welcome, and community norms may adapt as participation grows.

The goal is not perfection, but progress — made together.
