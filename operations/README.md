# Operations

This folder is reserved for internal operational documentation related to how Ctrl+Alt+Master is maintained and sustained over time.

Operational documents support consistency, clarity, and long-term sustainability for the people running the project.

---

## Purpose

Operations documentation may include:
- Internal workflows and decision-making notes
- Moderation or community management guidelines
- Maintenance routines for resources, calendar, or platforms
- Onboarding notes for trusted collaborators
- Temporary or evolving processes as the project grows

This folder exists to support the organizers, not to formalize bureaucracy.

---

## Scope

Not all operations need to be documented.

Documentation is added only when it:
- Reduces repeated explanation
- Prevents burnout
- Improves continuity during growth or transition

If a process doesn’t need to be written down yet, it doesn’t belong here.

---

## Visibility

Most content in this folder is intended for internal use and may change frequently.

Public-facing expectations and rules are documented elsewhere in the repository.

---

## Notes

This folder may remain minimal until operational needs emerge.

Its presence signals intent, not obligation.
